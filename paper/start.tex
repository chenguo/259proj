        In an effort to increase instruction level parallelism techniques such
as pipelining, out of order execution and operand forwarding.  However
these efforts come at a large power cost.  Out of order execution requires
a ReOrder Buffer (ROB), to commit the registers in program order.  This
structure has grown to be monolithic with numerous entries and read/write ports.
There is no current methods to efficiently and equally compare various
ROB advancements to improve power efficiency. We propose a loosely cycle
accurate model that keeps track of the power usages of the ROB.  Using the 
simulation tool, we are able to compare and contrast the affects of improvements
made on the ROB.  This also allows for a first line test to validate proof of
concepts for future power efficient ROB designs.

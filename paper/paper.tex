\begin{abstract}
	In an effort to increase instruction level parallelism techniques such 
as pipelining, out of order execution and operand forwarding.  However 
these efforts come at a large power cost.  Out of order execution requires
a ReOrder Buffer (ROB), to commit the registers in program order.  This 
structure has grown to be monolithic numerous entries and read/write ports.
There is no current methods to efficiently and equally compare various
ROB advancements to improve power efficiency.

\section{Introduction}
BLAH BLAH BLAH INTRO WEEEE
\section{Project Implementation}
	Our simulator provides a cycle accurate behavioral model of a standard circular re-order buffer.  At the outset of the project, the standard re-order buffer we intended to implement was a non-circular RAM-based re-order buffer.  However, after feedback from the course instructor and students it was decided that a circular buffer is more widely held as being the 'standard' buffer type and would serve as an ideal underlying model for power optimizations.  Thus, we implement and compare the standard circular re-order buffer to circular re-order buffers with the following optimizations: 1) Distributed (Cluster based) ROB, 2) Dynamically Sized ROB, 3) Reduced Output Port ROB (Retention Latch). The following sections outline each of the above model implementations as well as input instruction generation and power results tabulation.  
\subsection{Instruction Generation}
	We model the input to our simulator as a stream of integer and floatpoint instructions.  The instructions are represented at the bit-level and model MIPS instructions as closely as possible.  Each instruction consists of 1) Instruction type, 2) Source and destination registers 3) a PC.  Table XX indicates the types of instructions modeled.  Each instruction type also has a predetermined cycle execution time designating the number of cycles that must elapse between instruction issue and the completion of the instruction.  As modeling functional units goes beyond the scope of this simulator, instructions are flagged as complete after the listed number of cycles has elapsed.  The actual cycle counts are the same as those modeled in MIT's Graphite many-core processor simulator[REFXX], with the exception of LOAD and STORE.  The cycle counts corresponding to LOAD and STORE instructions are estimated as a predetermined 20 cycles each.  This is simply an estimation as the actual cycle count is heavily dependent on cache architecture and benchmark specific cache behavior.  Since both of these topics are beyond the scope of the simulator, we estimate the completion time of LOAD and STORE instructions as a set value substantially longer than the other more accurate instruction types.
\begin{table*}

\end{table*}
	Registers are generated in bit representation as 4 bits each totalling 12 bits for the s1, s2 and d registers in each instruction. Currently, our representation of instructions make no distinction between zero, 1, and 2 operand instructions.  All instructions regardless of type feature two operands.  This feature is supported by the fact that a memory hierarchy and functional units are not simulated by our system and as such immediate values have no direct use.  Further, every instruction features a d register regardless of type.  Because our simulator features operand forwarding from the ROB, it is necessary for the generation of registers to keep track of past destination registers to use as dependent operands in future instructions.  This history buffer is implemented as a rotating bit register from which prior destination registers can be indexed.
	Each instruction also features a program counter associated with the instruction.  While this is clearly a simplification of a real system, it serves the purposes of our simulation as a uniquely identifiable tag by which to differentiate instructions.  In both a real system and our simulator, a statically set 32 bit value is used to represent this PC/tag.  As such, the specific values contained in the PC/tag will yield accurate transition results (nonexistent) and is thus are irrelevant.  Simply starting the PC of the first instruction in the stream at 0 and incrementing by 4 each instruction guarantees uniqueness among PCs and serves the purposes of an instruction tag.
	The aforementioned instruction fields have multiple modes of generation.  Our simulator synthetically generates an instruction input trace based on a prescribed instruction profile.  The instruction profile features: 1) a percent rate of occurrence for each instruction type, 2) a rate corresponding to the interdependence of registers between instructions, and 3) an overall instruction count.  
	The instruction generator is currently capable of generating four distinct instruction streams corresponding to different instruction workloads.  The first instruction stream is marked as the default instruction stream.  It features equal percentages of each type of instruction as well as a 10% register dependence rate.  This register dependence rate was selected arbitrarily to act as a starting point for modeling data dependencies between instructions.
	The remaining three instruction streams are modeled after SPEC-FP benchmarks.  The benchmarks were chosen to represent three major modes of operation:  floating point heavy execution, integer heavy execution, and mixed type execution.  For a floating point heavy execution, 173.applu was selected and modeled.  173.applu models parabolic/elliptical partial differential equations and features almost exclusively floating point operations as well as a large number of memory operations making it useful as both a floating point benchmark as well as a long running memory intensive benchmark.  191.fma3d is used to model integer heavy execution.  It models finite-element crash simulation and features very few floating point operations and substantially fewer memory operations than 173.applu making it an ideal light-weight integer workload.  Finally, 183.equake is used to represent the average workload.  It models seismic wave propagation and features both integer and floating point operations as well as moderate memory usage.  As such it acts as a more representative general workload than the original default workload.  Each of the SPEC-FP benchmarks feature a 6% register forwarding frequency as is reported by [XX paper ref].
	For the purposes of our power comparisons, each of the above instruction workloads are normalized to generate 10000 instructions.  Such a large instruction window is ideal to allow buffers to fill and behavioral characteristics to develop.  The specific values used for each workload are listed in Table XX.
